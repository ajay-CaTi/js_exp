JS is High level , object oriented, multi paradigm programming language.

Prog lang:- is a language/ tool to instruct a computer what to do

High level :- We donot care about complex functionality like managening memory it will all handle by JS itself.

Objet oriented means that it is based on object for storing most kind of data.

Multi-paradigm:- it is so flexible versatile that we can use all kind of different programming style such as imparative or declarative programming means different way of structuring code.

# HTML

is respnsible for Content of the page

# Css

responsible for presentation of the page styling

# JS

responsible dynamic and interactive effects to any web page.
menupulate data, css
loade data from remote servers
build enntire application in browser that called web application

# Libraries & framework

are used to build web application easier and faster

# Server

can use JS on server using js runtime Nodejs

front end react , angular view
backend , server :- ode js
mobile applcation
react native, ionic
Native desktop:- Electron

# Symbol

Value of this is unique and cannot be change

# Bigint

Storelatge integers

# Exponential, Assignment ,Logical NOT operator

from R to L

# Most of rets operator

from L to R

# What id DOM?

Structured reperesentation of HTML Document. Dom Allow JS to access Html elements in order to menupulate them.

- Dom craeted by Browser stored in tree like structure
- In this tree each html element is object

# DOM !== JS

- DOM amd dom methods is not a part of JS
- It is part of WEB api
- Web APi is libraries & is written in JS
  like dom menupylation api

# WHat is JS?

JAVASCRIPT IS A HIGH-LEVEL, PROTOTYPE-BASED OBJECT-ORIENTED,
MULTI-PARADIGM, INTERPRETED OR JUST-IN-TIME COMPILED,
DYNAMIC, SINGLE-THREADED, GARBAGE-COLLECTED PROGRAMMING
LANGUAGE WITH FIRST-CLASS FUNCTIONS AND A NON-BLOCKING
EVENT LOOP CONCURRENCY MODEL

# Paradigm

Paradigm: An approach and mindset of structuring code, which will
direct your coding style and technique.

# Fnctional programming

It is programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure methamatical functional style

# first clas s function

first-class functions, functions are simply treated
as variables. We can pass them into other functions, and return them
from functions.

# Concurrency model

Concurrency model: how the JavaScript engine handles multiple tasks
happening at the same time

# why do we need that?

JavaScript runs in one single thread, so it can only do one thing at a time.

# what is thread?

Thread is like set instruction executed in computer CPU

# So what about a long-running task?

# How do we achieve that?

By using an event loop: takes long running tasks, executes them in the
“background”, and puts them back in the main thread once they are finished.

# Thread is where our code is actually execute in a machine processor.

# what is JS engine?

it is a compuetr program that execute JS code.

# what is JS engine contain callstack (where code execute) and Heap(stored object)?

# evet loop

# how code execute

# execution context

# scoping

# lexical scope

the function written inside anter functionn will have the acces to its parent function

# VAriable only Look Up access not Look down

# Features of JS

Scripting lang to powering web application
Interpreter based
form validation integral part
Very help ful wide range inbuilt function like isNAN(), Number(), parseFloat() parseInt()
light weight dynamic lanuage
statement looping

# Never ever use arrow function as method

# Arguements function only exist in Regular function

# Object(Reference type) stored in Heap

# Function() execure in Call Stack

# Primitive type stored ine xecution context

# Refrence type is known as refeence type

Because when we store an object, it will stored in heap(bec. objects are hug ein size) and its address is stored in CALL STACK just like[ --> address(0003) value(D30F) --> ] --> Address(D30F) value ({name:"ak"})
